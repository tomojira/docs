# Games with Parallel Releases

Some games have multiple versions that were released simultaneously in-parallel and are designed to interact with each other but offer differing play experiences while remaining at their core the same game. Ex: Mainline Pokemon games.

- Each version shall have its own set.
- Each versionâ€™s set shall have a different author.
- Sets whose versions were merged into one core set before this policy entered effect may remain merged.
    - Unmerging shall be allowed if a game currently has a merged core set, under the following requirements:
        - The author of the merged core set shall be given preference as to which version their work shall become.
        - Version-specific achievements in the merged core set shall be transferred with authorship intact to the other version upon unmerge.
        - The unmerge plan must pass a revision vote and approval by DevCompliance, with input from QA-Maintainers.
        - A satisfactory plan for how to handle unlocks for players that have earned the merged set achievements must be developed and approved.
- If in the future a means to play a core set and a subset simultaneously becomes implemented in such a way to allow this, an additional option of a single merge core set plus multiple version-specific subsets shall be available as a valid option instead of separate core sets. Version subsets shall be used to highlight the differences between the versions in this case.
- This policy only applies to retail games. Hacks with parallel releases shall not have separate sets unless there are significant differences, subject to approval by DevCompliance.
